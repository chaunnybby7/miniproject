## miniproject - Unit 02 : CSS Snippet Cheat Sheet

In this activity, I worked with a partner to build a webpage that will hold a collection of CSS snippets. 


## Instructions

The completed application should meet the following criteria:

* As a user, I can view a collection of labeled CSS snippets in a responsive grid.

* As a user, I can easily identify these CSS snippets by their headings.

* As a user, I can highlight a code snippet by clicking on it.

* As a user, I can view my application on a mobile device as well as a desktop.


## What have we done on this webpage
 
 Step 1: We created CSS variables at the root of the document to be used throughout the style sheet on the style.css file

 Step 2: We chose a dark background color on style.css for the body section. Because we wanted to create a neon light hovering effect when we 
 select or when the mouse hover over the boxes. 

 Step 3: We created header tags h1, h2, h3 and declared the style properties for each headings.

 Step 4: We created a flex container, container's (box) display property to flex. 

 Then, We added the flex-wrap property under the box section to display the flex element in multiple lines.
 Which is easier for viewers to read.

 Step 5: We created media queries that can help mobile device users view my application on their devices.

 This was done by resizing the box sections to a smaller size and declarining a flex-direction property. 
 Flex-direction specify how the inner elements are laid out in the flex container. 
 We chose column so the texts will stack in a column (vertically).
